# transferhub
TransferHub is a system that manages the distribution channel, focused in simplifying transferals in the reusing process. It announces receivers and givers, so they can find each other easily. TransferHub does not manage the exchange itself: it interacts with [DeviceHub](https://github.com/eReuse/DeviceHub) or similar ITAMS to acknowledge transferences and to retrieve the available devices.

Transferences have control mechanisms, usually backed up by a community.These mechanisms include ways to control the reputation of the users, and ways to find the best match between receivers wanting devices and givers. A social platform is an umbrella that joins specific DeviceHubs from donors, receivers, and other platforms building an electronic reuse ecosystem. The main features are capturing offers (donations) and demand (social projects) to trade with reuse professional service providers (preparation, installation, maintenance), a donation service (legal advice), a payment system, a social support crowdfunding and a recommendation system.

TransferHub is being built with [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8).
